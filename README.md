# Asteroid-Avoider

[UNDER DEVELOPMENT]

A small game where you play as a ship and have to avoid astroids.

I made this game during the Udemy course called "[Unity C# Mobile Game Development - Make 3 Games From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-mobile/)".

## Motivation
I wanted to review my basics, adapt my knowledge of game programming to mobile game programming so that I could then create my own games later.
